One of the fastest-growing habits among junior IT graduates is the endless chase for certifications. Don’t get me wrong, certifications matter. They showcase effort, they look neat on LinkedIn, and sometimes they open a door or two. But here’s the uncomfortable truth: certificates and endless courses alone don’t always translate into great opportunities.

##### The missing puzzle piece is often a portfolio.

Having a wall of certificates means little if there’s nothing real to point at. Even small, scrappy, this-never-worked-like-I-planned projects prove something crucial: the ability to tackle tough problems, debug calmly, and figure things out when the docs are vague. It’s easy to do just one more course, but it’s far better to implement, to learn by building. Don’t get stuck in tutorial hell. Get out there and build something.

## The balance

Certifications are worth pursuing, just do not make the mistake of treating them like the whole game. They are one piece of the puzzle. Pair them with projects that show creativity, grit, and the ability to create something a human can click on.

We are also lucky right now. AI makes mentorship feel close. You can refine ideas, ask for help building them, get explanations tuned to your level, and learn while building. The real limit is imagination, plus a little courage to release V1 when it is still rough.

## South African Perspective (2025)

A few local signals to ground the argument and help with portfolio strategy.

- Startups employ a large number of juniors (~37%), which aligns well with portfolios that showcase personal projects. (Source: <a href="https://www.offerzen.com/reports/software-developer-south-africa" target="_blank">OfferZen State of South Africa’s Software Developer Nation 2025</a>)
- Nearly 1 in 4 developers report company retrenchments this year, and 7% say there is a hiring freeze, so competition for open roles is harder and proof of impact is important. (Source: <a href="https://www.offerzen.com/reports/software-developer-south-africa" target="_blank">OfferZen State of South Africa’s Software Developer Nation 2025</a>)
- Almost 40% of developers plan to change roles in the next 12 months, which means more candidates applying for the same roles. (Source: <a href="https://www.offerzen.com/reports/software-developer-south-africa" target="_blank">OfferZen State of South Africa’s Software Developer Nation 2025</a>)
- Startups focus more on skills than formal qualifications, emphasizing the need for a strong portfolio of projects. (Source: <a href="https://www.offerzen.com/reports/software-developer-south-africa" target="_blank">OfferZen State of South Africa’s Software Developer Nation 2025</a>)
- Junior software developers are expected to see slower salary growth in 2025 than seniors, reflecting tighter budgets and selective hiring.

- Almost 40% of developers plan to change roles in the next 12 months, which means more candidates in the same pipelines. (Source: OfferZen 2025)
- Career growth confidence slid from 70% in 2022 to 63.6% in 2025, reinforcing the need to drive growth through visible projects. (Source: OfferZen 2025)
- Fully remote roles fell below 40% as office requirements rose by ~30% year-on-year, so portfolios should show collaboration habits that travel across hybrid setups. (Source: OfferZen 2025)
- Johannesburg developers have ~9.7% more buying power than Cape Town after cost-of-living adjustments, a reminder to compare offers with real-world context. (Source: OfferZen 2025)
- Women now account for ~22% of SA developers, up from 18% last year, but seniority remains skewed, so mentorship and visibility matter. (Source: OfferZen 2025)
- Only ~37.9% use coding assistants at work and 40%+ do not use them at all, which means showing practical AI-in-the-workflow can still differentiate. (Source: OfferZen 2025)
- Salary growth has slowed; in 2024 entry-level salaries dropped ~3.5% on average, so portfolios that evidence judgment can offset slow comp progression. (Source: OfferZen SA salary trends, 2024)
- Startups employ a large share of juniors (~37%), which aligns well with portfolios that show shipping under constraints. (Source: OfferZen 2025) -->

## My advice

### Just build something

Honestly, the best place to start is a portfolio. Don’t overthink it. Start simple if you have to. Follow guided project repos on GitHub to get a feel for how things are done, then start tweaking and making it your own. Here’s one I recommend: <a href="https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning" target="_blank">Guided Projects</a>. The more you build, the faster you’ll figure out what you enjoy and where your strengths are.

### Be Proactive

The job market has changed. A degree alone won’t make you stand out anymore. The market is full of smart graduates, which is great because it means more opportunities for innovation. Make creative noise. The kind of noise that says, _"look at me and the project I'm working on,"_ then show what you learnt from building it.

### Have the Audacity

Be a little delusional. Believe you’ll make it and do whatever it ethically takes. Someone out there will always be smarter, faster, or more practical, but have the audacity to think that’s you. Start conversations when you’re nervous. Share your projects. Ask questions. Put yourself out there.

#### Go hermit mode

Belief without work is just fantasy. Mastery still requires those 10,000 hours. Set aside time every day to lock in, focus, and practice.

### Stay curious

If technical research papers bore you, that's fine, but don’t check out of the conversation altogether. Read case studies, blogs, industry reports. Stay on top of AI, cloud, and software trends. Be at the forefront or risk being left behind. <a href="https://openai.com/research/index/" target="_blank">OpenAI Research</a>, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research" target="_blank">Anthropic Research</a>, and <a href="https://ai.google/research/" target="_blank">Google AI</a> offer great resources to keep up-to-date.

### Stay adaptable

Tech changes fast, and the people who thrive are the ones who can change with it. Pick up new tools, adjust to new ways of working, and lean into the unexpected. Show you can roll with the punches.

### Don’t sleep on soft skills

Honestly, you can be the best coder in the room, but if you can’t explain your work, work with others, or think through messy problems, you’ll struggle. Communication and collaboration are low-key superpowers.

Think clear **communication**, whether it’s writing documentation or walking a teammate through your thought process. Think **adaptability**, because tech stacks and requirements change faster than we’d like. Think **problem-solving** and **empathy**, because debugging isn’t just about code, it’s about understanding the people and use cases behind it.

### Deep dive into what excites you

Pick three domains that feel alive in your hands. Go deep and get practical. For me, software engineering was the foundation I got through university, and then AI and cloud clicked into place. They intersect everywhere, AI runs on cloud, and cloud is the backbone of tools like ChatGPT. These intersections form part of the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/the-next-big-arenas-of-competition" target="_blank">industries of the future</a>.

## The bigger picture

For decades, the tech world followed Moore’s Law: the idea that computers double in computing power every 18 months. Today, AI is accelerating that curve, and the “doubling” feels closer to every six months. In this landscape, certificates alone aren’t enough.

Experimentation is essential. Build. Break things. Try again. Certifications make you decorated. Projects make you dangerous.

## A personal realisation

I’ll be honest, I’ve been guilty of chasing shiny certifications & badges without a clear end goal. At some point I had to stop and ask: _“Okay, but what do I actually do with all of these?”_

That question led me to one of my passion projects: **Lifepath Career Planner**

Realizing I’m not the only one facing this, I started building an AI-powered tool that works like an “instruction manual for careers.” The idea is simple but powerful: create a holistic profile of a person: skills, hobbies, education, certifications, and interests, then use AI to recommend career paths that actually fit, based on their accomplishments so far. By learning from the routes senior engineers and professionals have taken, the model can guide junior devs and career changers alike. This isn’t limited to tech either. Whether you’re a graduate, a career switcher, or someone feeling stuck, the goal is to combine AI with human-centered design to map out personalized roadmaps for growth.

### First milestones & Lessons Learned

- **Career Map Visualization:** Building a node-based map for careers taught me that even the simplest visualization requires careful planning. Adding probability scores seemed straightforward, but it turned out to be a challenge in itself.
- **Basic Matcher:** Creating a system that explains why a career path was recommended reminded me that transparency is just as important as accuracy. People trust recommendations more when they understand the reasoning behind them.
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Working on the recommendation engine has shown me how complex it is to align AI predictions with real human goals. The math is pretty difficult.
- **Past Nodes (grey):** I realized that showing closed paths is just as important as highlighting open ones. Sometimes knowing what’s behind you is part of deciding where to go next.
- **Now Node:** This is a grounding feature. It's forcing me to think about how users actually see themselves in a system, not just the data points.
- **Future Nodes (green):** Designing these reinforced the importance of optimism in career planning. A tool like this shouldn’t just inform, it should inspire, and hopefully be fun.

As the screenshot above shows, the system is still rough. The past nodes are missing, some paths are misaligned, and there are features left to figure out. But that’s been the biggest lesson so far: progress in tech isn’t about perfection, it’s about iteration and learning in chunks.

## Wrapping up

Certifications matter. But they’re not the finish line, they’re the starting point. The real growth happens when you combine technical knowledge with practical action and the audacity to keep building, even when it’s messy.

That messy part? That’s where the real learning lives. That’s where the fun happens. And your portfolio ends up telling that story louder than any certificate ever could.

_If you’d like to collaborate, share ideas, or suggest features, I’d love to hear from you. I am always looking for new perspectives._
